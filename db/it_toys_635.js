Some of these missions come from Earth Defense Force 2025, some are brand-new, but they all have one thing in common: They're really, really, REALLY hard. Can you survive the Time of the Mutants?<br>  <br>VOLATILE NAPALM <br>A napalm discharge device for military use. Napalm sets everything it touches ablaze, damaging not only the target but the surrounding environment as well. Because it's possible to launch at different trajectories, it can also be used to hit enemies hiding behind cover.<br><br>SPARK LANCER<br>The first prototype of a new short-range weapon currently under development. Emits rays of energy to destroy its target. Has massive firepower, but since the energy dissipates immediately, its range is short. When the energy hits a target, it refracts to strike multiple targets at once.<br><br>REFLECTRON LASER<br>A special cannon that emits a highly reflective laser. Can be discharged in a narrow passage and, due to the trajectory change when it's reflected off of walls, the laser blast will zigzag along the corridor.<br><br>PURE DECOY LAUNCHER 5 PACK B [SEIRA] [MIYABI] [NOKO] [MITSUKI] [ANJU]<br>This scoped device launches a human-shaped balloon, delivered via a special bullet.

Press and hold the attack button to increase the throwing distance, and release it to discharge.

Its body has been painted after &#8220;Natsuiro High School : Seishun Hakusho.<br> <br>GIGANTUS TANK, EDF IFPS MARKINGS <br>A custom Combat Vehicle Gigantus with a Vulture cannon. To celebrate its debut, its makers painted heroes on its frame. People believe that the paint will protect them from the enemy&#8217;s attack...but it has no such effect, at least not any more so than any other good luck charm.<br> <br>GIGANTUS TANK, BULLET GIRLS MARKING <br>A specially painted Combat Vehicle Gigantus, armed with a smooth-bore gun with armor piercing ammo that can fire through multiple enemies. To celebrate its debut, its makers painted a goddess of war on its frame.<br> <br>GIGANTUS DCC-ZERO MARKING<br>A custom Combat Vehicle Gigantus. Its main cannon is a 105mm Howitzer.

Only a small number of these were produced. It's coated with gold paint that reflects radar waves, but it hasn't proven the effect yet. Due to the gorgeous looks, it's mostly used by commanders or for ceremonies.<br><br>BLOOD STORM<br>A convergent missile cannon. Missiles launched from this weapon will separate in the air and rain down on the enemy's head. Their damage pattern isn't limited to a single target, but an entire area.<br><br>BM03 VEGALTA GOLD<br>Gold coated model of the BM03 Vegalta. Only a small number of these were ever manufactured. This model is coated in gold so that it reflects radar waves. However, this is not very effective. After jumping, pressing the jump button again will activate the jet thrusters.<br> <br>STING SHOT<br>A new shotgun developed for use against giant creatures. For that purpose, it uses special bullets designed to penetrate several thick, oversized hides without missing a beat.<br>"],
